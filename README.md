## Overview
This is my portfolio site, built in React.js. It tells my story, from freelance artist to web-developer, in three acts: Past, Present, Future. It is a single page app which utilizes Reactstrap tab components. Majority of styling was done in CSS, with @media considerations for mobile screen adaptation.

## Deployment
